			<p>Scan through the different snacks and check whether there is something that might satisfy your cravings. The types of products that you can buy vary from machine to machine; however, most of them include some kind of chips, chocolates, cookies, and gums. Some machines offer healthy snacks such as baked chips, granola bars, and peanuts.</p>          
       <p>Even though most vending machines contain fresh products, it might be convenient to try to visually double check the expiration date of the snack you want to buy.</p>          
      <p>Also, it is important to <strong>inspect visually whether the item of choice is all the way to the front in the dispensing coil</strong>, otherwise, the item will not be push out when the coil spins.</p>

			Step 2: Get the Item of Choice Identification Code 
        </div>

        <div class="stepContent">

        <div class="stepDescription">
			<p>Once you have selected visually the item you want to buy, get its identification code. This code is located right below the item.</p>
			<p>In some vending machines this code is composed of a letter and a number like "C5"; however in some other machines, it is just a number.</p>
			<p>If for any reason the identification code is not visible (e.g., the snack itself is covering part of the code), try looking at the codes next to it (to the left, right, above, and below). In most vending machines the codes follow a sequence and by looking at the codes next to one item, it is possible to deduce its code.</p>
			<p>Remember this identification code since you'll be using it in the next steps.</p>
