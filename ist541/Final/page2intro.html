	<h1>Objective for this series of web pages.</h1>
	<p>Drought conditions across the country can disrupt our normal watering activities. Haphazard watering can run up our water bills, stress our water systems, and affect local water sheds. So let's be smart about watering our beloved plants and greenery.</p>
	<p>Among many ways to be water <strong>smart</strong> are drip systems. These systems put water <strong>precisely</strong> where you want it to go. This lessens the amount of waste and the monetary costs along with wasting.</p>
	<p>
	<h1>With the use of these training materials, participants will be able to navigate drip system terminology and procedures with 100% accuracy on the final quiz.</h1></p>
